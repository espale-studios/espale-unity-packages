## [1.0.8] - 2025-09-18

### Fixed

- `MathUtilities.ClampAngleNormalized` is now public.

## [1.0.7] - 2025-09-18

### Added

- Added `MathUtilities.ClampAngleNormalized` method. It works the same way as `MathUtilities.ClampAngle` but it normalizes the angle beforehand
- Added `RandomUtilities.Shuffle` and `RandomUtilities.GetShuffled` methods. They both take in `List`s or `Array`s as parameters and shuffle them. `RandomUtilities.Shuffle` replaces the original collection while `RandomUtilities.GetShuffled` returns a new shuffled version of the original collection.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-01-10

### Added

- Added `MathUtilities.IsInClosedRange` method. Does the same thing as `MathUtilities.IsInRange` but the range is closed (end points are included in the range.).

## [1.0.5] - 2024-12-25

### Added

- Added `MathUtilities.RemapUnclamped` method for remapping without clamping the value to the source range.

### Fixed

- Fixed `MathUtilities.Remap` not working as intented.

## [1.0.4] - 2024-12-19

### Removed

- Removed auto prefab instantiating system from `Singleton` as it was not functioning properly.

## [1.0.3] - 2024-05-08

### Added
- Added `MathUtilities.BezierInterpolation` method for interpolating between two ends of a [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve).

## [1.0.2] - 2024-04-29

### Fixed
- Fixed a stack overflow issue caused by `MathUtilities.Direction` `Vector2` override introduced in the last patch.

## [1.0.1] - 2024-04-28

### Added
- Added `ClampVector`, `RoundVector` `MinVector` and `MaxVector` methods to the `MathUtilities` class.
- Added `BetterDebug.Ray` and `BetterDebug.Line` methods.

### Changed
- `MathUtilities.Direction` now has a `Vector2` override.
- `RandomUtilities.RandomVector2`, `RandomUtilities.RandomVector3` & `RandomUtilities.RandomVector4` methods now work correctly and the range is now changeable.

### Removed
- Removed `Vector4` overrides for utility methods.
